# Art Gallery Generator Requirements
# 
# This file lists optional dependencies that enhance functionality.
# The core gallery generator works without ANY of these dependencies!
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or install only what you need:
#   pip install Pillow  # For image processing only

# ==============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Image Processing
# ==============================================================================
# Pillow (PIL) - For potential future image optimization features
# Currently NOT used by the generator, but useful for extensions
# Pillow>=9.0.0

# ==============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Video Processing  
# ==============================================================================
# OpenCV - For advanced video processing beyond ffmpeg
# Currently NOT used, but useful if you want to extend video features
# opencv-python>=4.5.0

# ==============================================================================
# DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES (Optional)
# ==============================================================================
# Code Formatting
# black>=22.0.0

# Code Linting  
# flake8>=4.0.0
# pylint>=2.12.0

# Type Checking
# mypy>=0.930

# Testing (when tests are added)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=3.0.0

# NOTES
# ==============================================================================
# 
# Q: Why are there no required dependencies?
# A: The generator uses only Python's standard library:
#    - pathlib for file operations
#    - zipfile for ZIP extraction
#    - urllib for downloads
#    - json for data serialization
#
# Q: What about ffmpeg?
# A: ffmpeg is a system-level tool, not a Python package.
#    Install it separately using your system's package manager:
#    - macOS: brew install ffmpeg
#    - Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg
#    - Windows: Download from ffmpeg.org
#
# Q: Should I uncomment the optional dependencies?
# A: Only if you plan to extend the project with those features.
#    The generator works perfectly fine without them!
#
# Q: How do I know if I need these?
# A: You probably don't! They're mainly for developers who want to
#    add new features or contribute to the project.
#
# ==============================================================================
# FOR NEW CONTRIBUTORS
# ==============================================================================
# If you're new to Python and want to contribute:
# 1. You DON'T need to install anything from this file to start
# 2. The project runs with just Python 3.7+
# 3. Only install dev dependencies if you want to run linters/formatters
# 4. See CONTRIBUTING.md for complete setup instructions
